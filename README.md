#Christian’s Wacky Keyboard


###Christian’s Wacky Keyboard is an emulation of the Patatap webapp. Originally intended to be a farm animal speak-n-spell, given the scope of the project, the current version was the most achievable over the 4 or so days of intensives.


###Wacky Keyboard uses Howler.js for its sound elements, using free sound files found through Howler resources, and pulling from an API parts of the script needed to output the sound.


##Installation


###simply download the files to your computer into their own separate folder, and open the main html file in any web browser of your choosing.


##Play Online

###If you would rather an online version, simply go to the website (HEROKU).
